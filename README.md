# About


This repo contains some malware analysis writeups I've created over time, mainly for fun. It serves as a personal portfolio aimed at centralizing and organizing my work.

Additionally, my current approach tends to be "quick and dirty" rather than "by the book" due to limited resources, knowledge, and time. If there is a dirty hack to accomplish something, I'll probably take that route.

I would be more than happy if someone learns something new or finds inspiration in this project.
