# About

This repo contains some malware analysis writeups i created over time mainly for fun.

I am not consider myself as a professional Reverse Engineer or some kind of an expert, This is a personal portfolio whose main purpose is to centralize and organize my work.

I would be more than happy if one learns something new or finds inspiration in this project.
