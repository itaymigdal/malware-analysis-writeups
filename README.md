# About

This repo contains some malware analysis writeups i've created over time mainly for fun.
This is a personal portfolio whose main purpose is to centralize and organize my work.

Additionally, my current approach tends to be "quick and dirty" rather than "by the book", since i have limited resources, knowledge and time for that. if there is a dirty hack to accomplish something, i'll probably take that way (example: I would prefer to debug over the IAT builder function, and then dump the new fixed binary to disk, rather then writing an Idapro script to resolve API staticly).

I would be more than happy if one learns something new or finds inspiration in this project.
